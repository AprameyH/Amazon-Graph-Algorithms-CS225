This week, we finished work on Tarjan's algorithm and got Betweenness Centrality working on both directed and undirected graphs. We spent a long time this week walking over the betweenness algorithm to better understand how it was implemented. Since Brandes's algorithm used directed graphs, on instances of undirected graphs, we realized we would get twice the betweenness value for each node. After we implemented the algorithm, we decided we needed to make our code much more efficient in order to be able to run Brandes's algorithm on the entire Amazon dataset. To achieve this, we decided to use node ID's instead of Node objects to calculate and store betweenness values.
