# Location of Code, Data, and Results
Most of our code is located within the algorithm and parsing folders. In the algorithm folder, we implemented Strongly Connected Components (SCC) using Tarjan's Algorithm and also implemented the Betweeness Centrality algorithm. In the parsing folder, we parsed the data, created a Node, Edge, and Graph class, and within the Graph class, we performed BFS. Our Amazon data of nodes is found within the data folder. We stored the results in
# How to build and run the executable

# How to build and run the test suite
