We worked on creating the base Edge class and created the Parser. We imported the data as well. We had issues with Git, specifically making sure everyone had the same code when merging code from Github. We almost deleted a lot of code from Github, so we reverted to an old commit. We added the Makefiles to the .gitignore and because they are different for every user, the code almost got deleted.
