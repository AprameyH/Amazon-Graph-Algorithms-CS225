We finished implementing BFS and Tarjan's algorithm as well as their test cases. However, while our recursive version of Tarjans algorithm was passing all our tests, we were running into stack overflow related seg faults on our large graph. So, we had to rewrite Tarjans algorithm to be iterative. We also implemented an iterative version of DFS this week to test whether we could run DFS on our graph.
