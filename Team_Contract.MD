# Team Contract

## Communication
### Team Meetings
We will hold 2 meetings a week that are 2 hours long(we can go over if needed). We will plan and work on the project during these meetings. We will hold one meeting during Tuesday and one during Sunday. We will be doing the meetings in person and use to discord to share our screens. We will have a recap at the end of each week of what we accomplished and post it in the discord in case anyone missed the meeting.

### Assistance
We will be using discord for communication. We will expect a response within the hour.

### Respect
At every meeting we will make sure to give time for everyone to state their ideas, and we will hold the meetings in person to ensure that everyone is contributing. In the case that someone is being disrespectful to the members or not completing their part for the project, we will inform the CS225 course staff and our mentor.

## Collaboration
### Work Distribution
We will be largely working on our projects during our meetings. We will also assign a different person each week the role of manager who will ensure that everyone is working towards their goals. In the event that someone can not attend a meeting, they will be required to do the work on their own time. At the end of each meeting, 

### Time Commitment 
We will decide as a group on what we wish to accomplish during the next meeting. Each person will volunteer on what they are going to work on in the next meeting. If no one volunteers for a task, it will be randomly assigned to a group member. We will expect each time member to work 4 hours a week  which will happen during our meetings.

### Conflict Resolution
If there is a disagreement between members, we will give each member the opportunity to state their case and then, if they still can't come to an agreement, we will hold a vote to determine who was right. If one member is not attending the meetings and not completing their work, we will first approach him privately and ask if there are any issues that are preventing them from completing their work. If we can still not come to an aggreement, we will contact our mentor on furter steps.
